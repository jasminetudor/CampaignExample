# CampaignExample
This is a draft of a campaign microsite. The campaign focusing on petitioning the Governor of Alabama to protect prisoners from the horrific violence occurring behind bars. 

#This is just a prototype
1. This site has not been made responsive and there are no web queries. It was made for screen size 1100 x 675, so I suggest viewing it in those dimensions through google developer tools.
2. I would add additional animation where the drawing looks like its being drawn as the user scrolls, leading the user on their journey through the page. 
3. I would love to add a video explanation of the issue below the section that outlines the murder rate doubling. It would be great to be in the style of a white board or art explanation like this done by EJI: https://eji.org/videos/slavery-to-mass-incarceration
4. Social media sharing links are not functional
